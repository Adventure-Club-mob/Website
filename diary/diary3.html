                                        The exciting experience of surfing will surely give you an
                                        unforgettable experience for a lifetime. To enjoy surfing the
                                        most, you need to be on a beach that has beautiful crashing
                                        waves that you can surf against. Of course, in the sport of
                                        surfing, patience is of utmost importance as you have to wait
                                        for the wave. At the same time, you should be willing to take
                                        chances at massive waves and keep calm if things get hectic.
                                        The Indian Ocean offers great waves to Sri Lankan coastal
                                        explorers. In the high season, the swelling grows up to eight
                                        feet. No matter whether it is your first time or you are a
                                        professional, it is always better to understand the water from
                                        a trainer to learn the basics of surfing in safe waters. So, peel
                                        off the waves with your surfs and let the adventure begin!

                                        Experience White Water Rafting in the picturesque Kelani River in
                                        Kitulgala covering five major rapids and four minor rapids. The
                                        distance covered is around five kilometers. Anyone over 10 years old
                                        can whitewater raft with the proper safety equipment and with a
                                        professional experienced team of river guides. While water rafting in
                                        this section of the Kelani River is an exhilarating experience. Rocky
                                        sections, rapids, and rafting through the boulders and rocks, create
                                        grade 2 to 3+ rapids. As the river widens, you will go past the exact
                                        location which was used to film ‘The Bridge on the River Kwai’. This
                                        location is also ideal for a refreshing swim with its cool and inviting
                                        waters. A flatter section of the lower gorge is ideal for those who
                                        want to enjoy the river and its surrounding beauty - without having to
                                        navigate through the thrills and spills of large rapids. This option is
                                        perfect for children and family groups. The changing contours of the
                                        route along with the gushing crystal clear waters, certainly make white water rafting at Kitulgala a
                                        novel experience. The white-water rafting adventure ends further down the river close to the
                                        Kitulgala town and this adventure takes 1 hour.

                                        In Banana ride, a long banana shaped boat is
                                        pulled by a motor boat at a very high speed,
                                        giving you the thrill of your life. Most popular
                                        among young and adventurous people, this
                                        trip gives you a joyous experience when you
                                        get out of the boat and the process of getting
                                        back on the boat is as much fun as riding it.
                                        With up to 7 adventurers sitting astride the
                                        giant inflatable Banana, the experienced
                                        speed-boat Captain will execute repeated
                                        sharp turns in his attempts to flip the Banana Boat upside-down and dump as many riders as
                                        possible into the water! Prepare to get wet! This is possibly the most hilarious activity as you try to
                                        defeat the captain’s best efforts at getting you into the Lagoon, as you hang on during this white

                                        transportation which were once used by fishermen in
                                        ancient times. There is nothing much different between
                                        these two, kayak uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the
                                        blade through the water on alternate sides to move
                                        forward and canoe uses a single-bladed paddle to propel
                                        the boat forward. Paddling through nature, exploring the
                                        wildlife and relaxing while enjoying the serene views of the
                                        surroundings, is all that one has got to do! All safety

                                        safely. Visitors can go on ‘turtle watch’ any
                                        evening of the year, where the volunteers from the center lead groups to the beach between
                                        8:30pm and 11:30pm where you can watch the turtles laying eggs or returning to the sea. As
                                        waiting for turtles to appear can take a couple of hours, patience is required. During the season
                                        5-15 turtles appear each night and off season it is approximately 1-2. The center has strict rules
                                        about not disturbing the turtles and visitors should be aware that flash photography and
                                        white/yellow torches are not allowed.

                                        Snorkeling in Sri Lanka is one of the best
                                        water sports that will thrill your senses! Go
                                        through the surface in the sea and be
                                        delighted by the tropical fishes, colored coral
                                        reefs, and the shipwrecks.
                                    </p>

                                        Snorkeling and scuba diving are very similar
                                        activities and the primary difference is that
                                        snorkeling only allows you to swim at the
                                        water's surface, while scuba diving lets you
                                        descend deeper into the sea. Equipment such
                                        as masks, fins and snorkels are provided by
                                        the center, along with a guide who will swim
                                        around with you. During your snorkel experience, if you want the adventure to reach its peak, you
                                        can try Bar Reef, located two kilometers off the coast of Kalpitiya which is considered to be Sri
                                        Lanka’s largest reef.
